Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, co-advised by [Aviv Regev](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/aviv-regev) (now at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/aviv-regev)) and [Fei Chen](https://www.insitubiology.org/people). I develop protegenomic tools to study cell signaling in tissues. In particular, I develop experimental and computational tools that measure how cells respond to drugs directly in their native tissue contexts, with focus on multi-modal single-cell genomics. 

I received my Ph. D. in [Systems Biology](https://ssqbiophd.hms.harvard.edu/) from Harvard University, and my S.B. in Biological Engineering from MIT.
